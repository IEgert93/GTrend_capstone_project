# Google Trends analysis in Germany (experimental)

This is an experiment and capstone project of Codecademy's course, where assignment was to use gtrendsR to fetch data from Google Trends. In this case I decided to experiment with three keywords and its search activity in Germany over two-year period (2020-08-01 â€” 2022-07-31). The idea was to find out with very small sample of keywords, how seemingly very distant searches from each other could have possibly links to one another. Since this is very experimental and not representative of German googling in any way. This was my personal choice of experimenting, which may have some potential to go further.
